# Network Contacts

This is a phonebook app that classifies the telecom for each contact number.

## Development History

I made this app in 2013, back when I started to learn Android development.

## App Features

* Filter functionality for Smart, Globe, Sun and Others (the buttons on top)
* Search-as-you-type (for contact names)
* Call and SMS (long press a contact to show a pop-up)
* Send an SMS to multiple people at once (click contacts to include then press Send Text)
