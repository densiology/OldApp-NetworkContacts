# Network Contacts

This is an Android phonebook app that classifies the telecom for each contact number.

## Development History

* I made this app in 2013, back when I started to learn Android development.
* Updated Gradle to make it run properly on Android Studio.
* Added permission checking to make it run properly on Marshmallow and above.
